                            Threat Source newsletter
                        










Welcome to this week’s edition of the Threat Source newsletter. 
This week, I'm coming to you from Cisco Live in San Diego where I've just talked to a room that some of you may have been in, so writing this feels a bit surreal. It's really hard to try and write a cogent newsletter with all that's happening in the world, some directly outside my door. To purposefully butcher Charles Dickens, "It was the worst of times, it was the even worse times." Nevertheless, I'm persisting.  
I've had great conversations with so many smart people this week, but I was reminded once again that the most important tool you can leverage in protecting and securing your environment is knowing your environment and knowing yourself.  
Knowing your environment can and should be tooled and processed so that it can be repeatable. Continuing to know your environment requires constant vigilance and effort. Knowing yourself requires a level of introspection that is hard — and honestly, sometimes I just lift the rug and sweep my issues under it when I can't tackle that negativity.  
I'll give you an excellent example: every single thing I write would get flagged as AI. Everything. Why? I use an em dash (“—”) for roughly every four words I write — sometimes more, if I let it fly. It's clear that I could never go back to school successfully, despite the comedy gold that it would produce. For those of you old enough to remember “Back to School” with Rodney Dangerfield, I think you can imagine. I don't even want to talk about my kludgy code. Sure, it runs, but at what cost? 
So my advice? Do as I say, not as I do. Learn everything about your environment in a repeatable way, with a clear and documented process. Then analyze your own weaknesses in your work — let's not try to make miracles happen — and identify chances for you to learn, fill the gaps in your skill set and then do it all over again. The bad guys are really good at learning your environment; make it as hard for them as you can. 
The one big thing 
Cisco Talos recently disclosed 
several vulnerabilities across various software
, including catdoc, Parallel, NVIDIA and High-Logic FontCreator. While most vulnerabilities were patched by their respective vendors, catdoc posed an exception as the vendor was unreachable, prompting Talos to provide patches directly.
Why do I care? 
These vulnerabilities highlight risks in widely used software, potentially exposing systems to attacks such as privilege escalation, memory corruption and data leaks. Understanding these risks is crucial to protect your systems. 
So now what? 
If you use these programs, update them immediately with the latest patches to protect yourself.  If you're on a security team, grab the latest Snort rules to detect possible exploits and keep an eye out for suspicious activity.  And if you're a developer, take notes from these vulnerabilities to strengthen your own code and avoid similar pitfalls in your projects. Security is everyone’s job!
