                            Threat Source newsletter
                        










Welcome to this week’s edition of the Threat Source newsletter. 
I’ve discovered that being a rent guarantor for someone is an involved experience. While I’m glad that I can help out a loved one secure a better rental property, the process of verifying my identity and ability to cover any missed payments required handing over far more personal and financial data than I was comfortable with. 
I asked the agent about their information security policies and cybersecurity posture. I was relieved to hear that they delete all the personal data within two weeks of processing, but I was concerned that the person dealing with my dossier didn’t think that they were at risk of a cyber attack. They believed that because they had a low online profile and their organisation was small, they didn’t present as a target. 
Not wanting to jeopardise my position as a guarantor, I didn’t argue further beyond offering a few words of advice. The truth is that everyone is a target. Many criminals do not discriminate; they seek to compromise anyone and see how they can make money from a compromise once access is achieved. Sophisticated criminals research their targets and their wider ecosystem of suppliers and partners in depth to identify potential weak points. It only takes a moment’s inattention for anyone to fall for a phishing or social engineering scam. 
Cybersecurity training needs to reinforce the fact that anyone can be a victim of a cyber attack. No matter how careful you might be, how insignificant you think that you might be, an attack can still catch you off guard. The good news is that by ensuring basic cyber hygiene, we can make a lot of progress towards preventing harm. 
Impressing on users the need to install updates promptly, the importance of having end-point protection and using multi-factor authentication is not a panacea, but it is a basic foundation upon which more advanced protection can be built. 
Good cybersecurity begins with an awareness of the threat, an acknowledgement that we are all at risk, and knowing the potential consequences. Nobody is too insignificant, too small or too well hidden to escape the risk of cyber attack. Suitable protection follows from reflecting on what is at risk and what could possibly go wrong.
The one big thing 
Talos has 
uncovered a destructive attack
 on Ukrainian critical infrastructure involving a new wiper malware, "PathWiper," deployed through a legitimate endpoint administration framework. Talos attributes this attack to a Russia-linked APT actor, underscoring the persistent threat to Ukraine's infrastructure amid the ongoing war. 
Why do I care? 
This attack highlights the sophisticated tactics of state-sponsored threat actors and the risks critical infrastructure entities face, which could have global implications for cybersecurity and geopolitical stability. 
So now what? 
Organizations, particularly those managing critical infrastructure, should strengthen their endpoint security, monitor for unusual administrative activity, and stay informed on evolving threats to mitigate potential risks.
